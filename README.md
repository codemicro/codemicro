Heads up! Most of code primarily goes on [git.tdpain.net](https://git.tdpain.net) as opposed to Github, but some is mirrored here.

```py
class AKP(Human):

  def __init__(self):

    self.likes = ["Making things", "Music", "Fancy stationery"]
    self.dislikes = ["Wrangling with indentation", "Recursive functions",
      "The cold"]

    self.pronouns = ["she/her"]

    self.languages = [Python, Go, HtmlCss, Java]
    self.technologies = [Docker, Ansible, LiteralMagic]
```
